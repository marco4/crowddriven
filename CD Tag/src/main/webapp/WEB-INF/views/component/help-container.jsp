		<h2>About the Crowddriven Project</h2>
		<p>The amount of video data on the web is growing cumulatively everyday, future prospects indicate that the amount of video data on the web will only continue to increase. The web and its consumers have changed. Before, content on the web was created by experts and access was limited due to knowledge and skills. With the socializing of the web, consumers are now transforming into producers, which actively contribute by uploading all sorts of video material. Videos on the web are queried by its description and the tags that the uploader is supposed to enter. User generated tags are generally inefficient for search queries, since the user either provides tags which are on an expert level or of low descriptive quality, leading to unfindable videos for the greater crowd.

		<p>Based on an extensive literature study covering engagement, crowdsourcing, search and browse methods, a Tag game and DIVE explorer is presented in the form of a single platform named Crowddriven. Crowddriven exists of an annotation game and an innovative linked data browser. The developed game allows users to watch a video and simultaneously enter tags in order to generate high quality tags for specific videos. Certain game elements are integrated in order to trigger continuous engagement of the user. The game is developed and optimized for both mobile and desktop devices, due to the growing amount of users consuming the internet from their mobile devices. The linked data browser allows users to explore data in a new and intuitive way, users can share, edit and flag certain events in order to improve their own search experience and that of others. </p>
